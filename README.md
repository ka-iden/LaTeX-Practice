# LaTeX Practice

Repo for practicing LaTeX.  
This is a repo where I drop files from my practice with LaTeX. It is not a complete project, but rather a collection of snippets and examples to help me learn and improve my LaTeX skills.
> [!NOTE]
> This repo will not be updated regularly, and will not include worked examples or any explanations.  
> It is simply a place for me to experiment with LaTeX and keep track of my progress.
